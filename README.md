**DogEar reimagines** how you manage a cluttered workspace by bringing the physical intuition of "book-folding" to the Windows desktop. It transforms your multi-window workflow by allowing you to fold a corner of any application—creating a visual **"DogEar" bookmark** that stays pinned to your target window, ensuring you never lose track of your active tasks again.

**Why DogEar?** In a sea of dozens of open windows, traditional taskbars and tab-switchers often fall short. DogEar provides a **persistent visual anchor** for your most important work. Whether you are tracking a critical document, locking a reference image, or managing complex multitasking, DogEar ensures your prioritized windows are instantly identifiable and always accessible.

**Note on Permissions:** To "dog-ear" windows running with Administrator privileges (e.g., Task Manager or elevated Command Prompts), **DogEar** itself must be launched with **Administrator privileges** due to Windows UIPI security constraints.

## 📥 Installation & Security

### 🛡️ Note on Windows SmartScreen
Because DogEar is an independent open-source project, the installer is **not digitally signed** with a commercial certificate (which costs hundreds of dollars annually). 

When you run the installer, Windows may display a blue **"Windows protected your PC"** warning. 
* **To proceed:** Click **"More info"** and then **"Run anyway"**.
* **Why this happens:** This is a standard security measure for apps that haven't yet established a global reputation with Microsoft. 
* **Trust:** You can verify the integrity of the app by checking the open-source code or building it from source yourself.

### 🔍 Verification
To ensure the installer hasn't been tampered with, we provide the **SHA-256 checksum** for every official architect in the [Releases](https://github.com/PythiaLaurus/DogEar/releases) page. 

You can verify the file integrity by running this command in PowerShell:
```powershell
Get-FileHash <path_to_installer> -Algorithm SHA256
```
