### 🚀 What's New

- **Interactive Feedback Polish**: Added missing mouse cursor indicators to all clickable areas. Interactive elements now consistently show a "hand" pointer on hover, making the interface more intuitive and predictable on desktop.
- **Enhanced UI Responsiveness**: Optimized the internal rendering logic to ensure that only the specific parts of the screen being modified will refresh. This results in a much smoother experience when toggling settings or updating data.

### 🧹 Maintenance

- **System Streamlining**: Optimized the application structure to improve overall stability and reduce memory overhead during navigation.
