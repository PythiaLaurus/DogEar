### 🚀 What's New

- **Targeting Logic**: Refined window selection. The "Always on Top" toggle now targets the **window directly under your mouse cursor** instead of just the foreground window, allowing for faster and more intuitive pinning.

### 🛠️ Improvements
- **Elevated Execution**: The application now defaults to **Administrator privileges**. This ensures seamless "Always on Top" functionality for all windows, including those running as Administrator (e.g., Task Manager, Command Prompt, or installers), without requiring manual "Run as Administrator" each time.
